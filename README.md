## 🛠️ Installation

- Inside the Controller folder, create a folder named `config` and inside it, create a file named `ENV.php` with the following structure:

```php
    <?php

    SERVER DATABASE LOCAL HOST

    $HOST_NAME      =   'localhost';
    $PORT_SERVER    =   '3306';
    $DATA_BASE_NAME =   'example';
    $USER_DATA_BASE =   'root';
    $PASS_DATA_BASE =   'root';
    
    ?>
```

- In the root directory, create a file named `ENV.php` that should contain the credentials for the app's password recovery email:

```php
   <?php
      // PHPMailer configuration file for sending emails
      // used for user password recovery.
          
          $emailHost      =   'test@gmail.com';
          $passwordHost   =   '123';
    ?>
   
 ```
